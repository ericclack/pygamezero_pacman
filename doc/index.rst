Pygame Zero : Pac Man tutorial
==============================

In this tutorial we'll use Pygame Zero to create a Pac Man clone. As
well as learning about sprites and game logic we'll use files to store
each level, which means you'll get to design your own levels, and
you'll learn how to read files in Python.

If you've not yet set up Pygame Zero and the editor Mu, head over to
the Flappy Bird Tutorial and follow the instructions there:

If you're new to Python programming then that Flappy Bird tutorial is
probably better place to start -- this tutorial is significantly
harder.
