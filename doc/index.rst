Pygame Zero : Pac Man tutorial
==============================

In this tutorial we'll use Pygame Zero to create a Pac Man clone. As
well as learning about sprites and game logic we'll use files to store
each level, which means you'll get to design your own levels, and
you'll learn how to read files in Python.
